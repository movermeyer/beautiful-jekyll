My name is Michael Overmeyer. I am a software developer living in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.
I specialize in solving data problems for companies that are themselves doing interesting things.

I've been developing software professionally since 2010. Over that time, I've been blessed to work on many interesting projects such as:

* [Satellite tracking of all the world's ships](https://exactearth.com/)
* [Miliatry Helicopter instument panel UIs](https://gdmissionsystems.ca/)
* [Air Traffic Control software](https://www.navcanada.ca)

I also [contribute to open source](https://movermeyer.com/open-source/).

I'm currently available for hire. If you're a software company that is pushing the bounds of human capability [give me a shout](https://linkedin.com/in/movermeyer).
