My name is Michael Overmeyer. I am a software developer living in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.
I specialize in solving problems for companies that are themselves doing interesting things with positive impact.

I've been developing software professionally since 2010. Over that time, I've been blessed to work on many interesting projects such as:

* [Satellite tracking of all the world's ships](https://exactearth.com/)
* [Military Helicopter instument panel UIs](https://gdmissionsystems.ca/)
* [Air Traffic Control software](https://www.navcanada.ca)

I also [contribute to open source](https://movermeyer.com/open-source/).

I'm currently [drawing the rest of the f-ing owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ0OB5tGyB8) and making commerce better for everyone (ie. happily employed at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)).
